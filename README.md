📈 Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression
📝 Problem Statement
Businesses often face challenges in predicting future sales accurately. This project aims to build a robust regression model to estimate future sales using historical performance data.
🎯 Objective
To develop a linear regression model that forecasts future sales based on key historical metrics like date, product type, quantity sold, and revenue.
📂 Dataset Requirements
- CSV file containing sales data with the following columns:
- Date
- Product
- Quantity
- Revenue
⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing or null values
- Convert date formats
- Aggregate or encode categorical variables (e.g., product names)
- Generate relevant features for regression
2. Model Building
- Apply Linear Regression using a suitable library (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Split data into training and test sets
- Train the model and validate performance
3. Visualization
- Plot actual vs. predicted sales values
- Display trends in forecasting over time
4. Evaluation
- Calculate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score
- Discuss accuracy and limitations
📊 Expected Outcomes
- Clear graphical representation of predicted vs actual sales
- Tabular forecast report for future time periods
- Insights into seasonal or product-based sales trends
🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for regression modeling
🚀 How to Run
- Clone this repository
- Place your sales CSV file in the working directory
- Run sales_forecasting.py or equivalent notebook
- View predictions and plots in the output folder or in the notebook
